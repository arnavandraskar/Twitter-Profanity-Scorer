# Twitter-Profanity-Scorer
The Twitter Profanity Scorer is a Python program that analyzes a given set of tweets and assigns them a profanity score based on the number of racial slurs they contain. The program reads in a CSV file of tweets, processes each tweet to determine its profanity score, and outputs the results to a new CSV file.
